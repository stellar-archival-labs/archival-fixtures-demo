#![no_std]

//! rapid-expiry-demo — a deliberately short-lived Soroban contract.
//!
//! This contract exists to give [`soroban-state-sentinel`](https://github.com/stellar-archival-labs/soroban-state-sentinel)
//! and [`action-state-watch`](https://github.com/stellar-archival-labs/action-state-watch) a
//! **real**, decaying, archivable testnet entry to watch — not a synthetic mock.
//!
//! It deliberately maintains exactly **one persistent entry** and never extends
//! that entry's TTL, so the entry decays on a predictable timeline until it is
//! archived and must be restored. That is the whole point: production contracts
//! silently lose access to persistent data when nobody watches the TTL, and this
//! contract makes that failure observable end-to-end on testnet.
//!
//! ## Why "short TTL"
//!
//! The shortest TTL an entry can have is the network's `minPersistentTTL`
//! parameter. The protocol enforces this minimum when an entry is created or
//! restored, and `extend_ttl` can only ever *raise* a TTL, never lower it — so
//! there is no way for a contract to create a persistent entry with a shorter
//! TTL than the network allows.
//!
//! On testnet (protocol 28, verified 2026-09-09 via `getLedgerEntries` on the
//! `CONFIG_SETTING` / `STATE_ARCHIVAL` config setting) that minimum is
//! **120,960 ledgers ≈ 7 days** at the ~5 s ledger cadence. We deliberately
//! write our entry and then never touch its TTL, so the demo timeline is:
//!
//! | stage | when | entry TTL |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | deploy + `initialize()` | ledger L | 120,959 ledgers (~7 days) |
//! | users keep transacting, nobody extends | each ledger | −1 ledger (~5 s each) |
//! | archived | ≈ L + 120,960 | 0 — reads/writes fail until restored |
//!
//! Verify the current network parameters before trusting these numbers — they
//! are set by validators and can change. See `docs/surviving-soroban-state-archival.md`.
//!
//! ## Why there is no `ttl()` function
//!
//! The protocol deliberately gives contracts **no way to read an entry's own
//! TTL** (CAP-0046-12: "there is no way for smart contracts to determine the
//! current TTL of an entry"; the soroban-sdk 27 `get_ttl` helpers exist only
//! behind the `testutils` feature, for tests). TTL monitoring is therefore an
//! **off-chain** job: `soroban-state-sentinel scan` and the repo's CI read the
//! TTL ledger entry via `getLedgerEntries` (see `scripts/read-entry-ttl.py`),
//! without invoking this contract. That is the production pattern this demo is
//! meant to teach — if your contract *needs* to know its TTL, you are fighting
//! the protocol design, and you should watch it from outside instead.
